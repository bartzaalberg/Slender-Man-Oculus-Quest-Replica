Push both throttles forward to accelerate. Pull either throttle backward to turn in that throttle's direction. Pull them both backward to reverse.\nPress and hold either trigger button (or both) to lose traction and engage drifting. Let go to recover traction.\nPress the B or Y button (or both) to align your ship with the terrain. This is necessary for things like wall riding and loops.
