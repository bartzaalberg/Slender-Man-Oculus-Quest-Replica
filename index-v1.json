Just setup your teams with bombers and fighters and then dive into the action, pilot your ship around the station, watch your radar and lock onto enemies. With two powerful lazers and a 50-meter 'fast boost' teleport, winning the battle is a matter of carefully planning your attacks, keeping distance from bombers and chasing down enemy fighters as they dodge and weave through space. Adjust power to different components of the ship: \nshields, blaster recharge, boosters, and check the live map for positioning info. Make smart choices. Stay alive. Defend the station!",

As such, this project is meant to act as a conversation piece around topics like self-image, abuse, coping and addiction. \n\nThroughout the project, users are placed in a series of thematic rooms. Each room reflects a moment in Becka’s journey and is accompanied by a set of equally thematic paintings that can be completed by the user along with audio from a fictionalized version of Becka’s life written by the artist herself. Each one of these rooms essentially makes a gallery, a place where the artwork stands in the context of Becka’s life.",
