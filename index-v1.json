      "description": "Space Pilot Alliance is a slow-paced strategic space-fighter sim. Just setup your teams with bombers and fighters and then dive into the action, pilot your ship around the station, watch your radar and lock onto enemies. With two powerful lazers and a 50-meter 'fast boost' teleport, winning the battle is a matter of carefully planning your attacks, keeping distance from bombers and chasing down enemy fighters as they dodge and weave through space. Adjust power to different components of the ship: \nshields, blaster recharge, boosters, and check the live map for positioning info. Make smart choices. Stay alive. Defend the station!",
